Algorithm Characteristics​​
1. ​​Multi-Component Hybrid Architecture:​​
	​​Linear Congruential Generator (LCG):​​ Classical random number algorithm.
	​​Xorshift:​​ Efficient bit-manipulation generator.
	​​Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR):​​ Provides strong diffusion properties.
	​​Multiplicative Confusion:​​ Enhances non-linearity.
​​2. Processing Flow:​​
	[LCG Update] --> [Xorshift Transformation] --> [LFSR Shifting] --> [Multi-State Combination] --> [Final Non-Linear Mixing]
3. ​​Enhancement Techniques:​​
	64-bit Bit Rotation
	Multiplication by Large Prime Numbers (to mitigate periodicity)
	Multi-Round XOR-Shift Operations
	State Self-Update Mechanism
​​4. Statistical Property Optimization:​​
	Compromising linear correlation through multiple non-linear operations.
	Utilizing components with differing periods to reduce repetitive patterns.
	Employing strong diffusion operations at the final output stage.
5. ​​Security Enhancements:​​
	Utilizes a high-precision time source by default for seeding.
	Pre-whitening is applied during state initialization.
	Output bears no direct, discernible relationship to the input seed.
